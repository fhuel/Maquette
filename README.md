# Maquette #
## Photoshop Interactive Prototypes Generator Script ##

 
### DESCRIPTION ###
AD Maquette is a Photoshop script that generates
interactive prototypes from your Photoshop mockups.
All you have to do is to follow really simple naming conventions.
Organize all your pages (or application status) with layer comps.
Name your link layers/layerGroups starting with a "**#**" (e.g. `#pageName`) and the relative link over status layer/layerGroup with an ending "**:hover**" (e.g. `#pageName:hover`).
Where "**pageName**" is the name of the layerComp you want to link to.
If you want you can add a layer or layer group and call it **Background**. It will be used as a repeated background image for the generated html pages.
And then let the script do the rest.

This is a first beta release. This script needs a performance improvement and general bugfixes but at this point I find it really convenient already.
